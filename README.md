## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the Express server. <br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for use in the `/client/public/dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in development mode and continues watching for any changes.

For the purposes of this assignment I have left the bundle already built and ready to go.


- Steps to take to run the application in the browser:
  1. Navigate to the directory
  2. `npm install`
  3. `npm start`
  4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
